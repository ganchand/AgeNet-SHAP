AgeNet-SHAP: 
This work predicts brain age using brain ROIs (regions of interest) and then identifies the multivariate associations between these ROIs and brain age predictions. A basic deep neural network model does the prediction, and the significant multivariate associations are determined by using the SHAP feature importance technique. 
Our method is validated using a semi-simulated data, which is synthesized from the cognitively normal (CN) samples.
